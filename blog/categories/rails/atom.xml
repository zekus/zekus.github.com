    <id>http://zekus.github.com/blog/2009/03/22/rails-and-passenger-aka-mod_rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We tried to setup a rails application in a server subfolder in a way that could have been accessible through an URL like http://servername/rails,Â  so we followed the configuration manual for mod_rails.We found that, to make rails works in a subfolder, should have used the Apache parameter RailsBaseURI.</p>

<p>With a great surprise, that didn't worked so we started trying all possible apache configuration combinations to avoid that 404 error that was becoming a nightmare.</p>

<p>After few hours we started doubting about our Apache knowledge and even about our capacity of reading and following a couple of stupid instructions on a website!</p>

<p>We gave up and we started googling around when... the solution came out from dozens of blogs, forums and newsletters:</p>

<blockquote><p>MOD_RAILS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH RAILS 2.2.2 AND ITS NEW ROUTING SYSTEM</p></blockquote>

<p>"HOLY CRAP" was our esclamation and I will not mention here all the italian's bad words that suddenly came out from our mounth!</p>

<p>So, here the solution: put this line here
<code>
config.action_controller.relative_url_root = "/guestbook"
</code>
in your environment.rb</p>

<p>Now restart apache and enjoy!</p>

<p>ps. why hadn't we changed mod_rails with mongrel or anything different? I don't know!!!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally I started a little RoR project with my friend Antonello but we did it in the wrong way :D</p>

<p>We started from the database design (not exactly the rails way) and we are trying to solve problems that a Rails developer usually doesn't have like create the scaffold without migration scripts!</p>

<p>Here are 3 simple steps to do it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rake db:schema:dump (create the schema dump from the existing database)</p></li>
<li><p>mv db/schema.rb db/migrate/001_initial.rb (create the initial migration script manually)</p></li>
<li><p>script/generate scaffold firstmodule field1:text field2:varchar field3:date --skip-migration
The most important thing you should never forget is that your tables on the database must have a PLURAL name but use the SINGULAR name when you create the scaffold for that table.<br/>
( ex: the table name is "tools" but the command to create the scaffold is script/generate scaffold tool )</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Happy RoRing !!!</p>
