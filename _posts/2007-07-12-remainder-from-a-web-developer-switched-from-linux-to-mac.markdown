I just switched to Mac and I miss so much Linux and my fav distro Ubuntu :(
I was obliged to do so cause I had a great offer on a "like-new" macbook and my 1-year-old laptop with linux inside had to go to assistance ( bad Asus ).

After some time playin with [fink](http://finkproject.org) to set up a [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) or, better MAMP environment and rsync to move all my files on this new laptop, finally I started again with my work and one of the first things I missed on the keyboard ( mine is an italian one ) was:


> 
```
 a.k.a. backtick a.k.a apice inverso ( in italian :D ) -> alt+9
~ a.k.a. tilde or twiddle or squiggle -> alt+5
# a.k.a.Â  **hash** a.k.a **cancelletto** -> alt+3


It is not difficult to fnd this information on google but I decided to write it here like a reminder for myself ;)

Anyway, my mac adventure is started even if I'll never abandone linux that run in a Virtual Machine ( [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/mac) ) for now...
