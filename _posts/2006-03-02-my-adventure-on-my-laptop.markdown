If still fighting with ubuntu breezy on my laptop. 

I like it cause it's faster but I miss my opensuse.10 with kde :( You can ask me why I left from there if I miss that... because of speed and eclipse (not disposable for Qt).

Anyway, the only problem I got is with ndiswrapper.

Stay tuned for updates.
