First of all, if you installed the SuSE personal like me, you should change the source installation!
  

  
Do this :
  


  
  1. open YaST
  
  2. from left pannel choose "software" and from right choose "change installation source"
  
  3. click "add" button and choose ftp or http and fill the form using a [SuSE mirror](http://www.suse.com/us/private/download/ftp/int_mirrors.html)
  

  
  4. then disable the cd source and enable the source just added (dont enable more than one source or YaST will freeze when you will add packet choosin "install/uninstall packets")
  

 Now we can install Gaim with his dependancies.
  
For installing using an rpm go to [guru.linuxbe.org](http://guru.linuxbe.org/), download gaim and install it wit YaST!
  

  
EASY SuSE!! I love it.
