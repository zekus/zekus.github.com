Wow, I just noticed that my last post was 50 days old... I must have been busy, haven't I?  
So, what am I doing? The first part time website in Ruby on Rails is going to be published and I was working on that almost every evening and weekend with Antonello.  
I should have written something about Rails and Ruby in here but ... there is already a lot of material around the web.  
  
Maybe I'll post something on GIT that is a bit more obscure :)
