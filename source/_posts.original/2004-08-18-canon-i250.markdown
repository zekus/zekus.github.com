I found drivers for this cheap printer on this site :
  

  
[http://203.111.45.57/bj/i250linux/](http://203.111.45.57/bj/i250linux/) (CANON NEW ZELAND)
  

  
and downloaded the following:
  


  
  * bjfiltercups-2.3-0.i386.rpm
  
  * bjfilteri250-2.3-0.i386.rpm
  
  * guidei250-2.3-0.tar.gz
install rpm with YaST as usual and unpack the last package cause this is the guide!
  
then, always in YaST, go to "hardware"(on left), "printer"(on right) and add your printer!
  

  
It WORKS WOW!!!!!
