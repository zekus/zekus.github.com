This morning I had a lot of problems with my Eclipse Ganymede installation: svn plugin (subversive) refused to work properly... well, actually, it didn't worked at all!!

After some time trying to understand the source of the problem, I came out with a GREAT IDEA : "I can remove some file from my workspace folder!!!" So I went there, I displayed the hidden folders, I entered in the .metadata folder and deleted all folders related to svn and team plugins and ... you know what?? It f#*king worked...

I love how Eclipse doesn't help in solving this... F%Â£k IT!

But, at the end, is a good IDE...

bye
