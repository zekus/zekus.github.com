We have a faulty Windows 2k server in our firm so I decided to make an experiment to replace it: I'm installing an Ubuntu Server (my fav linux distro) with the free vmware server where I'll load the old win2k server coverted in a virtual machine!

Stay tuned cause I'll post all the details about the HARD operation here!
