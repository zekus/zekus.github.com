As you can read in one of my previous post, changin installation sources, now you can  upgrade to Kde 3.4 directly via yast.  
>>> Easy!  
Go to Yast control center, then choose 'Install/Remove packages'. In the new loaded panel choose 'packet groups' from the drop-down menu and then 'zzz.All' from left frame. Click with right button on right frame and hit 'all in this list->update if a new version is available'.  
>>> End!  
well done... enjoy your new Kde desktop!  
  
bye  
Antonio
