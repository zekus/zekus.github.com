This is a [useful tutorial](http://alephzarro.com/blog/2007/01/07/installation-of-subversion-on-ubuntu-with-apache-ssl-and-basicauth/) I've found to install subversion in Ubuntu. It doesn't work on feisty cause  there is no **apache2-ssl-certificate** script in the new Apache2 packet, so you need to follow [this Apache directive](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/ssl_faq.html#selfcert)
