It is sooo strange but this Logitech optical doesnt work on OpenSuse 10.0 and you have to act a trick. I hate this cause people get far from linux when they get problems like this =( and I HATE this... wanna see linux on every machine I sell and I hope this for the future.  
Anyway this is the trick:  
  
open Yast -> System -> bootloader configuration  
modify the boot option and add psmouse.proto=imps to Other Kernel Parameters  
reboot  
  
and that's it!  
  
enjoy your suse
