I have been using the dotdeb repository on karmic for a while, but today, when I installed the new Lucid Lynx, it just became a mess so I decided to keep all the original ubuntu packages (Lucid ships php 5.3.2) and find an alternative repo for php-fpm which I use on my dev machine.   
Here it is:[Brian's php5-fpm : Brian Mercer](https://launchpad.net/%7Ebrianmercer/+archive/php/)  
  
Happy 10.04! :)
