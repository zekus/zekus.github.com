<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Principles</strong></p>

<strong>Abstraction</strong> is the ability to factor out the common features of an entire category of data objects and place them in a separate definition. Such a definition is abstract because it defines a class of objects rather than a specific object.

<strong>Encapsulation</strong> is the ability to wrap data and logic in an object, allowing complex programs to be built from simple (on the outside) objects. The complexities are literally hidden in the objects, with substantial benefits in reliability and maintainability.

<strong>Inheritance</strong> is the ability to define one object as a variation of another. The new object is said to inherit the properties of the original object, except for those properties which itoverrides, or assigns a different value to.

<strong>Polymorphism</strong> is the ability to use such a variation (or "subclass", in objected-oriented terminology) wherever an instance of the original class is expected.

<strong>Reliability</strong>. OO techniques minimize the dependencies between parts of the system, so bugs are more likely to be localized.

<strong>Maintainability</strong>. OO allows complex applications to built out of simple components; the simpler a component, the cheaper and quicker it is to fix or modify.

<strong>Extensibility</strong>. OO components are intrinsically extensible, even in ways unforeseen by the original developers, so changes to meet new requirements are possible and often inexpensive.

<strong>Reusability</strong>. OO solutions lend themselves to generalization. OO techniques make it possible to build abstract, high level solutions which can be customized and adapted for specific circumstances. As a result, OO developers are less likely to find themselves "reinventing the wheel".
