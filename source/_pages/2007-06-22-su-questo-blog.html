This blog is about Antonio Lorusso and his experiences in the world. 
The most of the post you will find are about computers, technology, computer programming etc.. because ... that's my world!
This is mainly a sketchbook where I can copy-and-paste my memories given the fact that I use to forget things quite often. If those notes are useful for someone else, I'll be pleased :)
