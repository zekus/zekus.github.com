In this page I'll list all the books that are in my shelves and that I think are interesting. I will try to put a quick review next to each of them that, the most of the times, you will find useless.

All the books are listed in random order and are linked to Amazon just in case you want to buy a copy and contribute to the hosting costs of this blog.

"A must" from the beginner to the advanced user of MySQL. It gives you what the other books on MySQL don't ( at least the books I've read :D )<span class="clear"> </span>
