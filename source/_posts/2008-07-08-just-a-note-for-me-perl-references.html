I said not to jump the chapter 4 of the Camel book (the Dromedary one) otherwise you'll not know what @{...} (literally: at plus curly brackets) do!!<br />As explained in page 252, that expression, dereferenciate an array reference returning the array itself.<br />Remember that arghh..<br /><br />ps. why Perl should be so complicated?<br />
