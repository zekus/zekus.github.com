If you have this error after tryin a commit, for sure you have replaced a standard file with a symlink or viceversa, haven't you?

In that case, what you have to do is just <strong>svn add &lt;the resource changed&gt;</strong> and svn will replace the file with the new one!

Were you already scared :D ?

Anyway, the correct procedure to replace a real file with a symlink in svn is the following:
<ol>
	<li><strong>svn remove</strong> of the file you want to link</li>
	<li><strong>ln -s &lt;link&gt;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>svn add</strong> of the new link</li>
</ol>
