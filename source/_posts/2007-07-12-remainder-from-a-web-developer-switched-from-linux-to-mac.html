I just switched to Mac and I miss so much Linux and my fav distro Ubuntu :(
I was obliged to do so cause I had a great offer on a "like-new" macbook and my 1-year-old laptop with linux inside had to go to assistance ( bad Asus ).

After some time playin with <a href="http://finkproject.org">fink</a> to set up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> or, better MAMP environment and <span style="font-weight: bold;">rsync</span> to move all my files on this new laptop, finally I started again with my work and one of the first things I missed on the keyboard ( mine is an italian one ) was:
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">`</span> a.k.a. <span style="font-weight: bold;">backtick</span> a.k.a <span style="font-weight: bold;">apice inverso</span> ( in italian :D ) -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">alt+9</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">~</span> a.k.a. <span style="font-weight: bold;">tilde</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">twiddle</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">squiggle</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">alt+5
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"># </span>a.k.a.Â  <strong>hash</strong> a.k.a <strong>cancelletto</strong> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic;">alt+3</span></blockquote>
It is not difficult to fnd this information on google but I decided to write it here like a reminder for myself ;)

Anyway, my mac adventure is started even if I'll never abandone linux that run in a Virtual Machine ( <a href="http://www.vmware.com/mac">VMWare Fusion</a> ) for now...
