I have been using the dotdeb repository on karmic for a while, but today, when I installed the new Lucid Lynx, it just became a mess so I decided to keep all the original ubuntu packages (Lucid ships php 5.3.2) and find an alternative repo for php-fpm which I use on my dev machine. <br />Here it is:<a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ebrianmercer/+archive/php/">Brian's php5-fpm : Brian Mercer</a><br /><br />Happy 10.04! :)<br />
