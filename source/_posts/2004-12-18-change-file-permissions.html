Again a simple command to simplefy our life on linux/unix machines :D
<br />
<br />As you know I am a webmaster and usually I need to upload files on webservers that manage permissions in different ways from me on my machine and I have to chmod a large amount fo files. Using following command I can make this work in seconds :D
<br /><blockquote>    find . -type d -name public_html -exec chmod 0755 {} \;
<br /></blockquote>It searches (using find recursively (ie it checks folders and sub folders/directories and sub directories) for a directory (-type d) called (-name) public_html and when it does it runs the command (-exec) chmod 0755 (which sets the permissions so that the owner can read, write and execute/open the folder and all other users can read and execute/open the folder).
<br />
<br />Feel free to experiment and change this command on your machine
