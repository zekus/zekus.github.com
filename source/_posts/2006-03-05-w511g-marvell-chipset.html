I've had some problem and lost some time installing the right driver for this stupid wireless card, so I decided to help someone dont spare time...<br /><p>After ndiswrapper installation, Just install the Win2k driver you'll find on your cd and absolutely NOT from NETGEAR SITE: IT DOESNT WORK!!!!<br /><br />bye<br /><br />Antonio<br />aka<br />zubuntu (zekus on ubuntu)<br /><br /></p>
