These days I had to quickly implement some tedious forms for a friend and I needed a quick way to validati them with jQuery so ... I've found this useful library: <a href="http://dnaide.blogspot.com/2007/05/validationaide-easy-as-client-side-form.html">validationAide</a><br /><br />Give it a try!<br />
