<br />The cron tables are located in /var/spool/cron/tabs. /etc/crontab  serves as a systemwide cron table. Enter the name of the user who should run the command directly after the time table. In Example 10.1, “Example of an Entry in /etc/crontab”, root is entered. Package-specific tables, located in /etc/cron.d, have the same format. See man cron.
<br />
<br />Example 10.1. Example of an Entry in /etc/crontab
<br />
<br />1-59/5 * * * * root test -x /usr/sbin/atrun && /usr/sbin/atrun
<br />
<br />/etc/crontab cannot be processed with crontab -e. It must be loaded directly into an editor, modified, then saved.
<br />
<br />A number of packages install shell scripts to the directories /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, and /etc/cron.monthly, whose instructions are controlled by /usr/lib/cron/run-crons. /usr/lib/cron/run-crons is run every 15 minutes from the main table (/etc/crontab). This guarantees that processes that may have been neglected can be run at the proper time.
<br />
<br />The daily system maintenance jobs have been distributed to various scripts for reasons of clarity. They are contained in the package aaa_base. /etc/cron.daily contains, for instance, the components backup-rpmdb, clean-tmp, or clean-vi. <div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/zekussuse" title="Subscribe to my feed"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/flchklt.gif" alt="" style="border:0"/></a></div>
