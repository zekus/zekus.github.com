Today, mysql wont startup and dont know why (or maybe!)
<br />First of all I looked at "/var/lib/mysql/<\your host name\>.err" log and this was the error:
<br /><blockquote>Fatal error: Can't open privilege tables: Can't find file: 'host.MYI' (errno: 2)
<br /></blockquote>The problem is the file was there (/var/lib/mysql/mysql).
<br />The solution is delete /var/lib/mysql/mysql wit command rm -fR,
<br />type rcmysql start and the folder will be recreated.
<br />You'll lost all users but mysql will be up and running! Now you have to reset the root password: mysqladmin -u root password
<br />
<br />hope to have been useful again!
<br />
<br />P.S.
<br />I forgot... the error was my fault ... I played too much with phpmyadmin.
<br />Machines do always what we want they do!
