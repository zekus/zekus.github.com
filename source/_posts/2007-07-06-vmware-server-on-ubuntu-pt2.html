Damn! All went almost well installing vmware-server but  I'm still getting crazy on iptables.
I'm playing with <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org" title="Official Firewall Builder website" target="_blank">Firewall Builder</a> that, at moment, seems more complicated than iptables itself!

Anyway... I'll link a pair of reference used to install vmware-server on ubuntu Feisty and vmware-server-mui (the web interface of vmware):<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware/Server?action=show&amp;redirect=VmwareServer" target="_blank"></a>

The summary of this three sites is:

Register for free to <a href="http://register.vmware.com/content/registration.html">http://register.vmware.com/content/registration.html</a> and get your serials

Add the commercial repo from Canonical
```

deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu feisty-commercial main
```
in your /etc/apt/sources.list and update your sources```sudo apt-get update```Install the vmware-server package```sudo apt-get install vmware-server```Apply the following patch to /etc/pam.d/vmware-authd to make permissions work well:

```

#%PAM-1.0
auth required pam_unix_auth.so shadow null
ok
account required pam_unix_acct.so
```

get the Management Interface pack

```

wget http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmserver/VMware-mui-1.0.2-39867.tar.gz
```
unpack it and install

```

tar zxvf VMware-mui-1.0.2-39867.tar.gz
cd vmware-mui-distrib/
sudo ./vmware-install.pl
```

fix mui boot script

```

cd /tmp
wget http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/httpd.vmware.diff
cd /
patch -b -p0 &lt; /tmp/httpd.vmware.diff
```

Now, your vmware server is installed and runnig and you can access to your management interface from firefox at <strong>https://localhost:8333</strong> or via the Management Console at "<em>Applications -&gt; Administration Tools -&gt; VMWare Server Console</em>".

Wait for Pt.3 of this adventure where I'll talk about networking and VMWare ( ... if I'll survive ... )!
