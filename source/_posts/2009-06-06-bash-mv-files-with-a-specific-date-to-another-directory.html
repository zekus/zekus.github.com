I was searching for a bash command to move files and directories from a folder to another with modified in a specific date for ages on google until I gave up and decided to write it myself:

```

 ls -l | awk '$6 == "2009-06-04" { print $8 }' | xargs -t -i mv {} /destination/folder
```

To understand what this line does, you need to know a bit about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">awk</span></a> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">xargs</span> (try "man xargs" in your shell)

Explaination:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
ls -l</span> : directory listing
<span style="font-weight: bold;">awk '$6 == "2009-06-04" { print $8 }</span> : take the files and dir with date 2009-06-04 and print the list
<span style="font-weight: bold;">xargs -t -i mv {} /destination/folder</span> : execute the mv command. {} is the result from the previous command.

I would like to explain you more, but I'm quite lazy and I leave you with google to undestand better the commands I've used.

Have fun! ;)
