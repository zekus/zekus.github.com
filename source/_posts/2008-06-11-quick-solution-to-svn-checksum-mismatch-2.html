If this error afflict your quiet development day, I'm sorry :D
I had this problem today and I solved in few steps:
<ol><li>make a backup of the working copy in a different directory</li><li>delete only the corrupted directory from your working copy</li><li>make an svn update</li><li>copy back only the modified files you need from the backup copy to the current working copy</li><li>commit your changes</li></ol>Now breath deeply and take a cold shower: I suppose you must be sweat! :D
