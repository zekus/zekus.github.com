I was looking for this useful function I always use in php and found this simple <a href="http://assasiner.wordpress.com/2006/12/03/is-in-array/trackback/">article</a>.
Basically, the function that permit you to do that is <strong>grep </strong>used in this way:

```

my $string = ‘fin_helm’;
my @array = qw/full_plate manteau boots two_handed_sword fin_helm/;
if(grep $_ eq $string, @array)
{
print “$string is in the array”;
}
```


easy?
