I'm so disperate... my linux SuSE, after a boot this afternoon, crashed...
  

  
It mounted filesystem in readonly mode and I dont know why, cause I havent made changes on system.
  
The only solution I found after hours searchin on google and groups is : REINSTALL.
  
i'm so ... sad and angry
  

  
see ya
  
antonio
