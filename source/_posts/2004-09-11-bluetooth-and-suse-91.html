It costed to me a lot of work, but finally <span style="font-weight: bold;">I got IT</span>!
<br />My bluetooth phone work and I can browse it.
<br />
<br />First of all, connect your bluetooth.usb.key directly on usb port without using hubs or will not work (dont know why but I'll solve it in future).
<br />
<br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">UPDATE</span> the deafault kdebluetooth installed with your suse wit this one <a href="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/supplementary/KDE/update_for_9.1/applications/.link/kdebluetooth.rpm">kdebluetooth</a>
<br />because it lacks a lot of necessary files you need for make it work.
<br />
<br />After that, start kbluetoothd and you'll have an icon in system proces pannel click on it and it will show u the services disposable on your phone. that's all (well ... there are a lot of things to learn so read here: <a href="http://kde-bluetooth.sourceforge.net/">kde-bluetooth.sourceforge.net</a>)!
