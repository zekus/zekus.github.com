In suse the kmail folder is situated in /home/user/.kde/share/apps/kmail. <br /><br />If you have reinstalled your system and opening kmail and clikkin on mails they magically disappears ... well I think it is a kmail bug!!!<br />Anyway just stop clikkin on mails, close kmail, go in emails folder (the folder above) and delete all indexes (*index*)<br /><br />hope to have been clear and helpfull as usual.<br /><br />happy suse, happy people.<br /><br />Antonio<div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/zekussuse" title="Subscribe to my feed"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/flchklt.gif" alt="" style="border:0"/></a></div>
