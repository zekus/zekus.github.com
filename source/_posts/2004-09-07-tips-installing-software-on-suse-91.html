To install RPM files with Yast from command line, type this : yast -i <\packagetoinstall\>.rpm
<br />
<br />If you downloaded source code from a program (tar.gz files) you can quickly make an RPM file from it.
<br />To do this, first of all install the package "checkinstall", then unpack your source package and cd to the directory where you unpacked the tar.gz file.
<br />Run the following commands:
<br />
<br />./configure
<br />make
<br />checkinstall #instead of make install
<br />
<br />When finished, you'll find your RPM in /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i686
<br />
<br />Now you can install it where you want with yast - i <\packagetoinstall\>.rpm or with rpm -i <\packagetoinstall\>.rpm. This allows your to easily uninstall it afterwards.
