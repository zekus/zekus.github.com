Not sure if this is the complete way of doing it (I'm not telling you which .deb to install), but it worked for me:<br /><br />Remove some waste from eventual previous compilations:<br />
```

<br />$ rm -rf /usr/loca/lib/libsvn*<br />$ rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libapr*<br />$ rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libexpat*<br />$ rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libneon*<br />
```
<br />Run autogen<br />```<br />$ ./autogen.sh&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />```<br />Configure and install (it is important to follow the order)<br />```<br />$ ./configure<br />$ make -j external-all<br />$ make -j local-all<br />$ sudo make install<br />```<br />That's it. Hope to have helped someone as usual.<br /><br />
