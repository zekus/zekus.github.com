Today I got a funny problem: I create a new link on Desktop of my Home folder.
  
My Surprise was that his name was "TRASH FOLDER".
  
So I thought "WHAT's UP?? Who gave this name to my home folder??". The first Thing I've done ( as ex-Winzozz User ) was right-click on folder to access properties and change the name there, but .... the name didn't change.
  
Well I demistyfied that, to change the name of folders, there is an hidden file inside every folder-link on desktop called ".directory". Here you can change some property, included the name "TRASH FOLDER".
  

  
:d see you
