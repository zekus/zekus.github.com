It costed to me a lot of work, but finally I got IT!
  
My bluetooth phone work and I can browse it.
  

  
First of all, connect your bluetooth.usb.key directly on usb port without using hubs or will not work (dont know why but I'll solve it in future).
  

  
UPDATE the deafault kdebluetooth installed with your suse wit this one [kdebluetooth](ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/supplementary/KDE/update_for_9.1/applications/.link/kdebluetooth.rpm)
  
because it lacks a lot of necessary files you need for make it work.
  

  
After that, start kbluetoothd and you'll have an icon in system proces pannel click on it and it will show u the services disposable on your phone. that's all (well ... there are a lot of things to learn so read here: [kde-bluetooth.sourceforge.net](http://kde-bluetooth.sourceforge.net/))!
