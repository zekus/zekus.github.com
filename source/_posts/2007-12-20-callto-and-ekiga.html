Building the call center, I needed to handle the protocol callto:// the crm use for phone numbers. In default ubuntu (gnome) installation, the protocol is handled via gconf form gnomemeeting. As I need to use ekiga, I had to change the key /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/callto
from "gnomemeeting -c %s" to "ekiga -c %s" via gconf-editor.

After the first test, I understood that, for using that phone number to make a sip call, that change was not sufficient and I needed a bash script:

#!/bin/bash
foo=$1
ekiga -c sip:${foo#callto://}

Just copy and paste it in text file that you can name "ekigacallto" if you like, and save it in /usr/bin or wherever and "chmod +x ekigacallto". After having done that, change the key again in gconf with "ekigacallto %s".

bye
