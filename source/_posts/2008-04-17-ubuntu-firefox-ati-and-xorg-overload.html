I was stuck with firefox and xorg on my Ubuntu machine: it was so slooooow. Today, finally, I've found a solution: just add the following option to your xorg.conf file under the device section:

```


Option "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" "true"

```


then reboot your machine or your xorg server only (ctrl-alt-backspace) and ...

breath deeply :O
