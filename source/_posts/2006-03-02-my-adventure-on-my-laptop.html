If still fighting with ubuntu breezy on my laptop. <p>I like it cause it's faster but I miss my opensuse.10 with kde :( You can ask me why I left from there if I miss that... because of speed and eclipse (not disposable for Qt).</p><p>Anyway, the only problem I got is with ndiswrapper.</p><p>Stay tuned for updates.</p><p>Antonio</p>
