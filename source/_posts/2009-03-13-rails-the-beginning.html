Finally I started a little RoR project with my friend Antonello but we did it in the wrong way :D<br /><br />We started from the database design (not exactly the rails way) and we are trying to solve problems that a Rails developer usually doesn't have like <span style="font-weight: bold;">create the scaffold without migration scripts</span>!<br /><br />Here are 3 simple steps to do it:<br />	<ul><li>rake db:schema:dump (create the schema dump from the existing database)</li>	<li>mv db/schema.rb db/migrate/001_initial.rb (create the initial migration script manually)<br /></li>	<li>script/generate scaffold firstmodule field1:text field2:varchar field3:date --skip-migration</li></ul>The most important thing you should never forget is that your tables on the database must have a PLURAL name but use the SINGULAR name when you create the scaffold for that table.<br />&nbsp;( ex: the table name is "<span style="font-weight: bold;">tools</span>" but the command to create the scaffold is <span style="font-weight: bold;">script/generate scaffold tool</span> )<br /><br />Happy RoRing !!!<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=6ccfe230-6968-422e-b5c5-6c6f3bfe43ec" /></div>
