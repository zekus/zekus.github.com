It's important to understand how LTSP works because I spent a few hours to find an explanation. Now I want to share better this knowledge on the web because it is considered an implicit information by various wiki and tutorials around.
<span>
As convention it is used the word "server" to express the machine where the LTSP system is installed and "client" the chroot directory.</span>

This is a clean and plain explanation for all dummy as me out there:
<span>
</span>
<span>1. A minimal operating system boots on each thin client. this operating
</span>
<span>   system comes over the network and in the usual case has no applications
</span>
<span>   or user accounts whatsoever.
</span>
<span>
</span>
<span>2. X server (graphical system) starts up and a login screen program (LDM)
</span>
<span>   starts so you see a username prompt.  This runs on the thin client.
</span>
<span>
</span>
<span>3. When you provide username and password, LDM takes those details and
</span>
<span>   attempts to log you on to the server.  If successful, you see a desktop
</span>
<span>   which is running on the server but displaying on your thin client.
</span>
<span>
</span>
<span>All accounts are on the server.  You can create an account on the thin
</span>
<span>client, but that's only really useful for debugging.  You can press
</span>
<span>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;atl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; to get a text console on the thin client and login with
</span>
<span>your local thin client account.  This is really not for <strong class="highlight">users</strong> though.
</span>
<span>
</span>
<span>All user programs run on the server.  This is why WINE is visible when
</span>
<span>installed on the server but not when installed on the client.</span>
