As I told in one of my previous post, I switched to an Apple Macbook thanks to a great offer I found on eBay but, I continue to use linux at work and in a virtual machine on the macbook too. One thing I really miss when I'm on linux is definitively TextMate! Thanks to <a HREF="http://grigio.org/textmate_gedit_few_steps">this blogger</a> I've found a great compromise with gedit that I want to share: thanks GRIGIO!!!
