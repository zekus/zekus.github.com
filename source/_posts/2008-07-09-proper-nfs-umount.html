Hi

if you try to umount an NFS mountpoint this way

```

root:~&gt; umount /mountpoint
```

and your shell answer this way

```

umount: /mountpoint: device is busy
umount: /mountpoint: device is busy
```


then try killing all processes using the mountpoint and update the nfs export fs

```

root:~&gt; fuser -k -m /mountpoint
root:~&gt; exportfs -au
```


at this point, you can safely umount

```

root:~&gt; umount /mountpoint
```


peace!
