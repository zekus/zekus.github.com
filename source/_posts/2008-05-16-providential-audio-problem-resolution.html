<p class="newsitemlrgtxt">More Linux Audio Foolery</p>
Well another day another Ubuntu upgrade. Another time my soundcard REFUSES TO WORK!
The problem manifests itself with the following error on trying to access sound from either gnome-sound-properties or even from the terminal as a non-root user.

audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Could not open resource for writing

Grr. Anyway a pretty simple one this - somehow my desktop user account had lost permissions for the audio device in the <strong>users-admin </strong>utility.

The biggest problem here was that my user wasn't showing up in said utility  - the fix is easy:

Open <strong>gconf-editor </strong>as root.

Open<strong> apps-&gt;gnome-system-tools-&gt;users</strong>

Create a boolean key called <strong>show_all (</strong>ignore the showall key that's there already<strong>)</strong>

Set it to true :-)

If you've got <strong>users-admin </strong>still open you'll see the accounts pop up automagically.

Then just re-enable all the GUI permissions for the account.
