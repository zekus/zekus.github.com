I've lost a lot of time to make ekiga works on LTSP environment.

1) ekiga, pulseaudio and alsa 1.0.14 by gutsy:
this configuration didn't worked out-of-the-box because  of an error in alsa pulseaudio plugin. You have to upgrade alsa to 1.0.15 and, to do so, install linux-modules-backports from the gutsy backport repository or you have to recompile alsa with all his plugins and modules.

2) you can't run ekiga for every user logged in via LTSP server out-of-the-box: you have to change the default sip listen port of ekiga for every user via gconf-editor to look like this<a href="http://antoniolorusso.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/schermata-editor-della-configurazione-sip.png" title="sip ports"><img src="http://antoniolorusso.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/schermata-editor-della-configurazione-sip.thumbnail.png" alt="sip ports" /></a><a href="http://antoniolorusso.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/schermata-editor-della-configurazione-ports2.png" title="ports"><img src="http://antoniolorusso.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/schermata-editor-della-configurazione-ports2.thumbnail.png" alt="ports" /></a>
