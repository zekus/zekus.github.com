[Sam Ruby: RadRails/Eclipse on Breezy - take 1](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/10/26/RadRails-Eclipse-on-Breezy-take-1): "Here is a quick fix for running Eclipse as it is installed by apt-get. This issue seems to be that the feature.xml file is in an unexpected directory.  I went to /usr/lib/eclipse/features and typed:  
 sudo ln -s org.eclipse.rcp.source_3.1.  1 org.eclipse.rcp_3.1.1  
  
After this, I was able to run the updates successfully."  
  
;) Happy Ubuntu
