Wow, I just noticed that my last post was 50 days old... I must have been busy, haven't I?<br />So, what am I doing? The first part time website in Ruby on Rails is going to be published and I was working on that almost every evening and weekend with Antonello.<br />I should have written something about Rails and Ruby in here but ... there is already a lot of material around the web.<br /><br />Maybe I'll post something on GIT that is a bit more obscure :)<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=7e92c0b0-f27e-8f67-92ee-b92a9c7f3d71" /></div>
