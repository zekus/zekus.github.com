Complaining, screaming, sweating, swearing .... why it doesnt work ... jeeeeeezzz

```


/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-2.3.8/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_specification.rb:76:in `establish_connection': Please install the postgres adapter: `gem install activerecord-postgres-adapter` (no such file to load -- active_record/connection_adapters/postgres_adapter) (RuntimeError)

```

<br /><br />And then a light ... "I upgraded postgresql recently!"<br /><br />Just reinstall the postgres gem and you are done...<br /><br />What a night!
