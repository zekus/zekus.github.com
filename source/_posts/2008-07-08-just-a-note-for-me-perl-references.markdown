I said not to jump the chapter 4 of the Camel book (the Dromedary one) otherwise you'll not know what @{...} (literally: at plus curly brackets) do!!  
As explained in page 252, that expression, dereferenciate an array reference returning the array itself.  
Remember that arghh..  
  
ps. why Perl should be so complicated?
