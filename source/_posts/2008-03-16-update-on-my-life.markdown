Hi guys, It's been a while from my last post: sorry but I've been busy.
I recently moved to London tryin to save myself from Italian way of underpay and understimate other's jobs. Here it seems that all goes as it should!
I'm working at [www.photobox.co.uk](http://www.photobox.co.uk) and soon I'll write more about Perl and Javascript without forgetting PHP and Linux stuff.

Stay Tuned
