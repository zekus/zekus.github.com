hello, yesterday I putted on my <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">ASUS L3500 laptop</span> the last linux <span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">SUSE 9.1</span> and it was great and easy. Since now I think this is the best linux version for beginners (and I am a beginner, ofcourse =D).
<br />For long time I wanted to do this change but I was full of job and I couldnt but, at least, here I am!
<br />
<br />I'm on my linux desktop now and I'm starting to install all application I need for work and live better on my pc.<my_password>
