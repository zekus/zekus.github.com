Well... FreeNX is the best remote controlling system now on earth and pretty easy to install on our Suse distro.<br /><br />Just open YaST and search for freenx and select all related packets.<br /><br />Do you think it's enoght? the answer that you are waitin for it's NO :D<br /><br /><a href="http://madpenguin.org/cms/index.php/?m=show&id=5755&page=1">I put here a link of a well done tutorial on MadPenguin.org</a> ( cause, you know, I'm lazy :P )<br /><br />And for you that dont understand why you cant still connect after this tutorial, here is the troubleshoot:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Error message Server not installed or NX access disabled </span><br /><br />If you see the following error message it means that the nx user's public key was not accepted.: <br /><br />NX> 203 NXSSH running with pid: 6721<br />NX> 285 Enabling check on switch command<br />NX> 285 Enabling skip of SSH config files<br />NX> 200 Connected to address: 192.168.2.21 on port: 22<br />NX> 202 Authenticating user: nx<br />NX> 208 Using auth method: publickey<br />NX> 204 Authentication failed.<br />This can be caused by a couple of things. <br /><br />the nx user's authorized key file /var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/authorized_keys2 is incorectly named. All versions of ssh that I have seen on Ubuntu, Fedora, Redhat/Centos and OFCOURSE suse are configured to look for an authoized key file names .ssh/authorized_keys not .ssh/authorized_keys2. You can rename the authorized_keys file but it might be better to reconfigure sshd_config because the nxserver --stop command renames the .ssh/authorized_keys2 to .ssh/authorized_keys2.disabled to prevent access via an nxclient <br />sshd is not running or is incorrectly configured. At minimum you need PubkeyAuthentication yes in the sshd_config file <br />The server and client public keys might be different. At install the server and client use a default key which should be changed. You can open /var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/authorized_keys and compare its contents to the key stored in the client by: <br />Open the client tool <br />Click the Configure button <br />Click the Key button on the General Tab <br />Ensure that the key matches the key found in /var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server<br /><br />Enjoy FreeNX, enjoy openSuSE<br /><br />Antonio<div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/zekussuse" title="Subscribe to my feed"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/flchklt.gif" alt="" style="border:0"/></a></div>
