I'm still curious about what happened to my SuSE and still angry about that!
  
Now I'm a little bit scared cause I think that if this happen when I'll have data on disk, I'll be lost! But let think over.... =D
  

  
I reinstalled also mozilla but, this time, I choosed the version without the installer and it worked on the first start... I HIGHLY reccomend it.
  
These are the operation I've done to install firefox via terminal:
  

  
download from site ( obvious! =D)
  
mkdir /opt/mozilla
  
mv /home/-user-/Desktop/firefox*.tar.gz /opt/mozilla/
  
ungzip firefox*.tar.gz
  
tar -xvf firefox*.tar
  
ln -s /opt/mozilla/firefox/firefox /home/-user-/Desktop/firefox
  

  
then you can apply the icon in kde!
  
thats all!
  

  
bye antonio
