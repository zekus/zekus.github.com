Haven't told you that I've installed the brand-new SuSE 9.2 on my laptop and It works great only if I use KDE. In fact I tried Gnome 2.6 and was so unhappy to see that it doesn't work good... Gnome it's hard to configure if u are a maniac of personalization. Let me know if your experience wit gnome have been better than mine!<br /><br />But, let's talk about the title's argument. It was so strange but, after a long "play" with yast and user configuration, I wasn't able to "su" or "sudo" from console. Still dont know what happened but that executables lost the suid privileges. What I've done, to make all things work again, was:<br /><br />chown 4755 /bin/su /usr/bin/sudo<br /><br />bye<div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/zekussuse" title="Subscribe to my feed"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/flchklt.gif" alt="" style="border:0"/></a></div>
