I'm still curious about what happened to my SuSE and still angry about that!
<br />Now I'm a little bit scared cause I think that if this happen when I'll have data on disk, I'll be lost! But let think over.... =D
<br />
<br />I reinstalled also mozilla but, this time, I choosed the version without the installer and it worked on the first start... I HIGHLY reccomend it.
<br />These are the operation I've done to install firefox via terminal:
<br />
<br />download from site ( obvious! =D)
<br />mkdir /opt/mozilla
<br />mv /home/-user-/Desktop/firefox*.tar.gz /opt/mozilla/
<br />ungzip firefox*.tar.gz
<br />tar -xvf firefox*.tar
<br />ln -s /opt/mozilla/firefox/firefox /home/-user-/Desktop/firefox
<br />
<br />then you can apply the icon in kde!
<br />thats all!
<br />
<br />bye antonio
