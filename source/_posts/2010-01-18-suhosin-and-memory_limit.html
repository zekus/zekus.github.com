I had some problem with a script that needed more memory to be executed and was using <b>ini_set('memory_limit', '50M').</b> For some reasons the memory was not incremented as expected.<br />After googleing around for a solution I just had an intuition: could be <i>suhosin</i>? Indeed, the problem was in the <i>suhosin</i> module that is enable by default on Ubuntu: it does not allow to redefine the memory limit over the limit specified in the php.ini file.<br />To make ini_set work normally under Ubuntu, comment out the <i><u>suhosin</u></i> extension in <i>/etc/php5/apachew/conf.d/suhosin.ini</i><br /><br />;)<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=49530aa3-b720-8bdb-8012-a9ae94d8b5ab" /></div>
