You can find many post outside the web disguising on <strong>how much and why a programming language sucks</strong>. In particular, I've found a lot with this argument about PHP.

Personally, I don't understand why programmers <strong>waste their time</strong> on writing this useless things. The more, I don't understand is why they attack PHP the most of the time... or maybe I know ... it's because it's the most used in the web, isn't it?

If it sucks, why the hell people and big enterprises persist in using it? Why the bloody hell BBC is going to migrate his websites on PHP platform? Why Facebook use PHP? Why Yahoo?

I'd like to link an article because it reflects my thoughts <a href="http://gordon-myers.com/?p=103">No, PHP does not suck; YOU suck</a>

Cheers.
