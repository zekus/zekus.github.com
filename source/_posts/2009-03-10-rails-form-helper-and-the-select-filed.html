The select helper methods fail if you invoke them using the form object.  Drop the "f." prefix.  The select
box is associated with the form via it's first parameter.  You should
pass the same instance variable used in your "form_for" declaration.

This will work:
< % form_for(@user) do |f| %>
__<p>
____< %= f.label "Admin" %><br />
____< %= select :user, :admin, [ ["True",1], ["False",0]] %>
__</p>
__<p>
____< %= f.submit "Create" %>
__</p>
< % end %>

This creates a select box that sets the 'user' objects 'admin' attribute
to 1 or 0.  The first parameter must match the 'form_for' instance
variable or they will not be associated with any lines like this;

@user = User.new(params[:user])

I hope that's clear for anyone having the same nightmare.  I found this
page especially useful on select boxes;
