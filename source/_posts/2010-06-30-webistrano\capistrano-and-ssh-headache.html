In theory, installing and using these two amazing tools is quite easy and straight-forward BUT ... you really need to have a deep SSH knowledge to make it works! I you dont, well ... you can loose like a whole day trying to figure out how the hell the connection does not work using the "password" parameter!

```

connection failed for: localhost (Net::SSH::AuthenticationFailed: antonio)

```


According to a member of the #capistrano freenode channel
<blockquote>codebeaker 15:28
^ I can't support password usersâ€¦
(sorry)</blockquote>
and then
<blockquote>codebeaker 15:32
basically as soon as I find the time, I'll be taking password support out
because it causes so many problems, and is unreliable</blockquote>
Well .. after a day of trying and reading all the documentation possible and google-ing in hope to find a solution. Can you immagine how angry and desperate someone can be?
Let's cut the crap now and let's talk about the solution:

create your ssh key
```

$ ssh-keygen
```
and dont use any password

/etc/ssh/ssh_config (NOT sshd_config) is your friend:
disable the password authentication and enable the rsaauthentication only (that's right, you cant have both or capistrano will refuse to work)

retry capistrano or webistrano deploy:check task ... 
enjoy!
