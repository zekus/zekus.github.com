hello, yesterday I putted on my ASUS L3500 laptop the last linux SUSE 9.1 and it was great and easy. Since now I think this is the best linux version for beginners (and I am a beginner, ofcourse =D).
  
For long time I wanted to do this change but I was full of job and I couldnt but, at least, here I am!
  

  
I'm on my linux desktop now and I'm starting to install all application I need for work and live better on my pc.
